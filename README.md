# Threshold Signature Schemes Analysis tool
WIP

Make sure you have g++ and make installed.
To run the tool locally using Poetry use (not required yet as there are no dependencies):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mseckar/tssinsights
cd tssinsights/miniscript; make; mv miniscript ../tssinsights
poetry install
poetry run python poc2.py
```

TODO: Create a working container setup.
